MobiKwik iOS SDK is a ready to use native solution for iOS applications (iOS 7 and above) to start accepting payments. This SDK provides both, fully functional user interface and API based methods for merchants who want to use their own interface.


## Payment Options
Based on requirements, merchants can choose from the following list of payment methods that are supported by SDK:
- MobiKwik Wallet Payments
- Card Payments
- Saved Cards
- Net Banking

>### Note
> All payment methods except MobiKwik Wallet, provide both UI and Non-UI functions. MobiKwik Wallet requires detailed user authorisation hence it contains itâ€™s own UI.
